## **Description**

Cï»¿reated as an entry into the Capital One Software Engineering Summit application challenge. This project was my first time using React. It is a simple web application where users can enter locations and dates to find the cheapest flights through the skyskanner API.

**Nï»¿ote:** The Skyscanner API changed its pricing model and no longer supports a free tier so the application is no longer functioning ðŸ˜¢.
